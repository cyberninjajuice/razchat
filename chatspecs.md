#Welcome to Raz Chat!
##Overview of development
Raz Chat is an open-source free tool for chatting using the terminal or command line hosted by me on data ocean. 

-  In ***Stage I*** of development the chatroom should allow users to all chat with their peers who have also joined the chatroom. Users will be able to access the history of the *all chat* by typing "/history" *3 hours for deployment*. This will also require setup on digital ocean *1 hour of deployment.*
- In ***Stage II*** of development users will be able to chat with each other or play an Arthimetic Test. *up to 1 additional hour*

- In ***Stage III*** of development users will be able to chat with each other and have users names and then be able to message each other individually and have that message reach only the user requested.*2 hours to deploy*

- In ***Stage IV*** of development users will be able to apply chalk colors to their text.*1 hour to deploy*

- In ***Stage V*** of development users will be able to receive automated therapy from their server. *1 hour to deploy*
